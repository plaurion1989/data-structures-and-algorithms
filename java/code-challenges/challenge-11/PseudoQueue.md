# Pseudo Queue
Create a new class called pseudo queue.
Do not use an existing Queue.
Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
* Methods:
1. Enqueue

Arguments: value
Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach


2. Dequeue

Arguments: none
Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach
## Whiteboard Process
Decided not to initiate a white board for this challenge.
## Approach & Efficiency
Having the Stacks process one operation (enqueue or dequeue) is the initial approach I intend to take.
